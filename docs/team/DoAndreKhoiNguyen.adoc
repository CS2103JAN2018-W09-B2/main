== PROJECT: contactHeRo

---

== Overview

contactHeRo is a desktop contact management application
made for Human Resource (HR) managers, specifically for
recruiters in a company.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *a calendar and the ability to arrange appointments on this calendar.*
** What it does: allows the user to arrange appointments on a calendar.
** Justification: This feature is beneficial to HR managers as they have many appointments. +
By putting those appointments on contactHeRo, they can easily add and check their appointments without switching tabs.
** Highlights: This enhancement has potentials for further development such as integrating with Google Calendar.It required working with all the main components of contactHeRo and a third-party API.

* *Minor enhancement*: added Profile Picture.
** What it does: allows the user to add people's profile picture.
** Justification: This feature is beneficial to HR managers as they need to contact with many people. +
By having profile pictures on contactHeRo, they can easily recognize and memorize people.
** Highlights: This enhancement has many approaches. Hence, it is challenging to choose the most suitable approach. This feature also helps me to familiarise with the code, especially the connection between model and UI
